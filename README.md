## How to launch QuaCoin Node
*Work in progress*
 1. Download source code
 2. Compile & run [src/main/kotlin/org/quacoin/P2PNetwork.kt](src/main/kotlin/org/quacoin/P2PNetwork.kt)
 3. Open in browser [`localhost:4657`](http://localhost:4657)

There might be different issues with current client implementation through ktor and i'm plannig to change client to TornadoFX. You should probably wait until proper release (i want it to be)
