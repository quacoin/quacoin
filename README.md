## How to launch QuaCoin Node
*Work in progress*
 1. Download source code
 2. Compile & run [src/main/kotlin/org/quacoin/P2PNetwork.kt](src/main/kotlin/org/quacoin/P2PNetwork.kt)
 3. Open in browser [`localhost:4657`](http://localhost:4657)

Probably you will have Quacoin working, but it isn't stable enough! I plan to shift from `ktor` and use something more best fitting (like TornadoFX). Also there is issues like very strange amount of cryptocurrency. You should probably wait until proper release (i want it to be)
